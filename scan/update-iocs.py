"""Refresh the indicator list from the project repository.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT, not part of the scanner. The scanner's strongest
guarantee is that it NEVER touches the network: it cannot be made to resolve or
contact an indicator, and that is enforced and tested. Putting an update feature
inside it would weaken that guarantee and the claim built on it. So updating is a
deliberate, separate act you run yourself, on a tool that plainly does reach the
network and does nothing else.

WHAT IT DOES
  Downloads the current indicator file from the project repo over HTTPS, checks
  it against a published SHA-256, confirms it actually parses as a valid, non-empty
  indicator set, shows you exactly what changed, and - only if you pass --apply -
  replaces your local copy. A dry run by default.

THE TRUST MODEL, STATED HONESTLY. This is a security tool for people who may be
targeted, so be clear about what the check does and does not prove:
  - HTTPS with certificate verification proves the bytes came from GitHub over an
    encrypted, authenticated channel. This is the same trust you place in GitHub
    when you download the tool in the first place.
  - The published SHA-256 catches a corrupted or truncated download. It does NOT,
    on its own, prove authenticity, because it is served from the same place as
    the file.
  - The new list is loaded and validated before it can replace your copy, so a
    malformed or empty download can never silently wipe out your indicators.
  - Detached signing is not configured for the current release. SIGNING.md is
    a maintainer setup guide, not evidence that a signature exists. This updater
    does not verify signatures. Do not treat its SHA-256 check as independent
    publisher authentication.

  For reproducibility, download a tagged release and compare its published hash
  with a build from that same tag.

USAGE
    python update-iocs.py                 # dry run: fetch, verify, show the diff
    python update-iocs.py --apply         # also replace the local indicator file
    python update-iocs.py --url <base>    # use a different base URL (e.g. a mirror)
