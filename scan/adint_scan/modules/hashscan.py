"""Hunt known sample hashes across the user-writable parts of this machine.

Citizen Lab (and others) publish SHA-256 hashes for the Windows payloads this
infrastructure delivers. Hashing every file on C: would take hours, so this
scans the locations an implant DLL actually lands in, plus anything the user
downloaded, and compares each file's digest against the sample hashes carried in
the IOC set.

A clean result means "none of these exact files are in these locations" - nothing
more. Each sample is one build; another victim's payload would hash differently,
which is why a clean hash scan is never a clean bill of health (D1/D3).

Contract: defines NAME and run(ctx) -> ModuleResult. Read-only, stdlib only, no
network (D2) - hashing a local file resolves nothing.
