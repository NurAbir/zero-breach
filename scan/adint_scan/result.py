"""Shared result types — the contract every scan module implements.

Doctrine baked into these types (SPEC-scanner.md):

  D3  Measured, never inferred. A module reports CLEAN only for checks that
      actually ran and found nothing. A check that could not run is UNKNOWN,
      which is a DISTINCT outcome from CLEAN. Never collapse the two.

Status values
  CLEAN    every check this module was meant to run, ran, and found no hit
  HITS     at least one indicator matched
  UNKNOWN  no check in this module could run (nothing was actually observed)
  PARTIAL  some checks ran clean, at least one could not run (gaps remain)

    #                it set, an HSTS header it sent, a connection record, a DNS
    #                resolution. Serious.
    #   attempted  - something on the device looked the name up, but a DNS filter
    #                answered with a block address, so no connection was made.
    #   configured - the name appears in local configuration (e.g. the hosts
    #                file) pointing somewhere REAL. A block entry (0.0.0.0) is
